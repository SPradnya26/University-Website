                Such situations are not uncommon for students looking to take admissions as the selection now will ultimately decide their career path ahead. 
                The trick lies in looking at the facilities available at the college, the resources you get, as the curriculum available and the faculty present 
                will only be as good as the amenities that you are getting in your college.

                Higher education system in India includes both public and private universities. Public universities are supported by the union government and the 
                state governments, while private universities are mostly supported by various bodies and societies. Universities in India are recognized by the 
                University Grants Commission (UGC), which draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. The main governing body is the University 
                Grants Commission, which enforces its standards, advises the government, and helps coordinate between the center and the state. Accreditation for 
                higher learning is overseen by various autonomous institutions established by the University Grants Commission (UGC).

                The higher education system in India includes both private and public universities. Public universities are supported by the Government of India and the state governments, while private universities are mostly supported by various bodies and societies. Universities in India are recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and co-ordination.[2]

                <p class="h2 text-center text-dark font-width-bold" style="font-family: reboot;">The types of universities include:</p>

                        <p>
                            Central universities, or Union universities, are established by an Act of Parliament and are under the purview of the Department of Higher Education in the Ministry of Education.[3] As of 14 November 2023, the list of central universities published by the UGC includes 56 central universities. 
                        </p>
                    </ul>

                        <p>
                            State universities are run by the state government of each of the states and territories of India and are usually established by a local legislative assembly act. As of 14 November 2023, the UGC lists 479 active state universities.[5][note 1] The oldest establishment date listed by the UGC is 1857, shared by the University of Calcutta, the University of Madras and the University of Mumbai. Most State Universities are affiliating universities administering many affiliated colleges (often located in small towns) that typically offer a range of undergraduate courses, but may also offer post-graduate courses. More established colleges may even offer PhD programs in some departments with the approval of the affiliating university.

                        <p>
                            Deemed university, or "Deemed to be University", is a status of autonomy granted by the Department of Higher Education on the advice of the UGC, under Section 3 of the UGC Act.[7] As of 14 November 2023, the UGC lists 124 institutes which were granted the deemed to be university status.[8] According to this list, the first institute to be granted deemed university status was Indian Institute of Science, which was granted this status on 12 May 1958. In many cases, the same listing by the UGC covers several institutes. For example, the listing for Homi Bhabha National Institute covers the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research and other institutes.

                        <p>
                            State Private universities are approved by the UGC. As of 14 November 2023, the UGC consolidated list of universities lists 455 state private universities.

                        <p>
                            Institutes of National Importance Apart from the above universities, other institutions are granted the permission to autonomously award degrees. However, they do not affiliate colleges and are not officially called "universities" but "autonomous organizations" or "autonomous institutes". They fall under the administrative control of the Department of Higher Education.[11] These organisations include the Indian Institutes of Information Technology, Indian Institutes of Technology, the National Institutes of Technology, the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, the Indian Institutes of Management and other autonomous institutes. These institutes are not listed below.

                </div>
                  
                  Also not listed are institutes which are under the control of the professional councils, without an approval of the UGC, e.g. Agricultural Universities, which are under the control of the Agricultural Education Division of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), one of the professional councils. 
                  The University Grants Commission (UGC) has also maintains a list fake Universities operating in India. UGC has said that these 24 self-styled, unrecognised institutions functioning in contravention of the UGC Act have been declared as fake and are not entitled to confer any degrees.[14] As of 14 November 2023, the list contains 20 institutions.
